{"name":"Dropdowns","description":"Dynamic tabbed interfaces should not contain dropdown menus, as this causes both usability and accessibility issues. From a usability perspective, the fact that the currently displayed tab’s trigger element is not immediately visible (as it’s inside the closed dropdown menu) can cause confusion. From an accessibility point of view, there is currently no sensible way to map this sort of construct to a standard WAI ARIA pattern, meaning that it cannot be easily made understandable to users of assistive technologies.","image":"http://localhost:3333/read/?image=image3.webp ","attributes":[{"trail_type":"easily","value":"123"},{"trail_type":"currently","value":"1232"},{"trail_type":"immediately","value":"5432"}]}
