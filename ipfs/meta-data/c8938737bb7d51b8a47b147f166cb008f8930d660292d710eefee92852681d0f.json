{"name":"Ratios","description":"Use generated pseudo elements to make an element maintain the aspect ratio of your choosing. Perfect for responsively handling video or slideshow embeds based on the width of the parent.\nUse the ratio helper to manage the aspect ratios of external content like \u003ciframe\u003es, \u003cembed\u003es, \u003cvideo\u003es, and \u003cobject\u003es. These helpers also can be used on any standard HTML child element (e.g., a \u003cdiv\u003e or \u003cimg\u003e). Styles are applied from the parent .ratio class directly to the child.","image":"http://localhost:3333/read/?image=image1.png ","attributes":[{"trail_type":"face","value":"best"},{"trail_type":"ear ","value":"normal"}]}
